# Extended examples for package DBLayer


## About

The notebooks in this folder intend to provide instructive examples for using package `dblayer`.


## Basics

Notebook **DBLayerBasics.ipynb** gives a short overview of the most basic functionality provided by package `dblayer`,


## Simulation Package

Notebook **SimulationPackage.ipynb** shows how co-simulation setups can be written/read to/from the database.


## Power grid models

Notebook **PowerGridModelWriteDB.ipynb** shows how a power grid model can be written to the extended 3DCityDB.
Notebook **PowerGridModelInspect.ipynb** shows how a power grid model can be read from the extended 3DCityDB and how the topological and topographical data can be inspected and visualized.
Notebook **PowerGridModelSim.ipynb** shows how a power grid model stored in the extended 3DCityDB can be extracted and used as a simulation model for [pandapower](https://pandapower.readthedocs.io/en/v2.0.1/index.html).


## Example: Inspecting a power grid model from the extended 3DCityDB

Notebook **ThermalNetworkModelWriteDB.ipynb** shows how a thermal network model can be written to the extended 3DCityDB.
Notebook **ThermalNetworkModelInspect.ipynb** shows how a thermal network model can be read from the extended 3DCityDB and how the topological and topographical data can be inspected and visualized.
Notebook **ThermalNetworkModelSim.ipynb** shows how a thermal network model stored in the extended 3DCityDB can be extracted and used as a simulation model for [pandathermal](https://github.com/IntegrCiTy/PandaThermal).



## Example: Simulating a power grid model stored in the extended 3DCityDB

Notebook **GasNetworkModelWriteDB.ipynb** shows how a gas network model can be written to the extended 3DCityDB.
Notebook **GasNetworkModelInspect.ipynb** shows how a gas network model can be read from the extended 3DCityDB and how the topological and topographical data can be inspected and visualized.
Notebook **GasNetworkModelSim.ipynb** shows how a gas network model stored in the extended 3DCityDB can be extracted and used as a simulation model for [pandangas](https://github.com/IntegrCiTy/PandaNGas).
